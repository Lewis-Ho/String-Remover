# String-Remover
Demonstration for removing substring from a string recursively using Python

Description
====
Write a function that accepts two strings, A and B, and removes all occurrences of A from B in such a way that the returned string C will have zero whitespace in it and will have zero occurrences of A in it. For example, if string A is “ab” and string B is “aabb” then C will be an empty string “”. Another example, if A is “)(“ and B is “((()))” then C will equal B.
